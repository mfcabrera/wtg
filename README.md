WTG - What's the genre?
===

WTG is a computer science project in the field of machine learning and in the topic of Music Information Retrieval (MIR). In this project we want to use a technique called Dictionary Learning (DL) to accomplish music genre recognition. DL consists of learning a dictionary based on a set of training data, and representing newly introduced test data as sparse vectors with atoms from the dictionary. The efficiency of this technique was already proven by many applications such as compression, recognition or classification of signals (e.g. images, speech, etc).
